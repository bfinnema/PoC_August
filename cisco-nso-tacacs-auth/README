1. Configuration

1.1. Installation

   In order to use this package, NSO must be run with access to the
   required Python packages found in requirements.txt.


1.2. NSO Configuration

   This authentication package needs NSO Package Authentication to be
   enabled.

   Enable Package Authentication by setting

       /ncs-config/aaa/package-authentication/enabled = true

   Add the TACACS+ package (cisco-nso-tacacs-auth) to the list of
   available authentication packages by setting

       /ncs-config/aaa/package-authentication/packages


1.3. Package Configuration

   In order to configure TACACS+ the cisco-nso-tacacs-auth.yang model
   needs to be populated with at least the following configuration.

   At lest one TACACS+ server needs to be added to the list of servers,
   /tacacs-auth/tacacs-server, and configured servers needs to be
   configured with host, port, and secret. Configuring a server's
   timeout is optional and will be defaulted to 10 seconds if not set.

   Required TACACS+ server host configuration:

       tacacs-auth tacacs-server host
       tacacs-auth tacacs-server port
       tacacs-auth tacacs-server secret

   To optionally set a client timeout value:

       tacacs-auth tacacs-server timeout


2. Usage

   When a user authentication request is made to the NSO server,
   configured TACACS+ servers will (when the interface allows it) be
   called to authenticate the request. When a server authenticates a
   user request, a session will be created for the user.

   If multiple TACACS+ servers are configured, they are tried in the
   order they are listed in the /tacacs-auth/tacacs-server list.


3. Requirements

   The response from the TACACS+ server must contain at least one group
   that should be assigned to the user.
